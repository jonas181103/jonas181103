### 🚀 Focus & Interests
-  **Academic Path:** Combining the structured world of Industrial Engineering with the deep technical layers of Computer Science and Quantitative Finance.
-  **Problem Solving:** I am particularly interested in how data-driven models can improve both financial integrity and cyber resilience.
-  **Mindset:** I value interdisciplinary collaboration and the challenge of translating complex theory into practical, secure applications.

### 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
- **Programming & Data:** - **Python:** Used for automation, scripting, and analytical tasks.
  - **SQL:** Foundation for structured data management and analysis.
- **AI & Deep Learning:** - Developed and trained an **original Neural Network** from scratch to understand the core mechanics of AI.
- **Cybersecurity:** - Continuous learning in Network Security and Pentesting (see my progress below).
